Inner join based on the key rep ID matching up with department mgr id

SELECT *

How to do a sub query

SELECT invoice_id, invoice_date,customer_id, total 
FROM invoice
WHERE total > 5.71;
We would remove the 5.71 and replace it with round brackets enclosing the first statement, like this:


SELECT invoice_id, invoice_date,customer_id, total 
FROM invoice
WHERE total > (SELECT ROUND(AVG(total),2) FROM invoice);
